		<h2>Flower of the Week</h2>
		<img src="images/iris_lg.jpg" alt="Large Iris" class="pic-right">
		<p>This week's featured flower is the white iris. This flower is white. It's an iris. You can trust me to tell the truth about that.</p>
		
		<p>It grows in the ground. It blooms in the spring. It's known as a spring bulb. It grows from a bulb and the bulbs multiply and if you aren't careful you'll have a whole field full of iris after a few years, because these bulbs are busy being prolific down there in the dark.</p>
		
		<p>Don't forget to cut some and take them inside because they smell really nice and they don't make you sneeze all that much.</p>
